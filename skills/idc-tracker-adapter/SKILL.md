# idc-tracker-adapter

The dispatch surface for the IDC v2 tracker interface (`WORKFLOW.md §3`). It resolves the
active backend from `docs/workflow/tracker-config.yaml::backend` and routes every call to
the matching implementation, so callers never hard-code `filesystem` or `github` semantics.
This is the surface the canonical chain terminates at — the glass wall between planning and
building.

## Backend resolution

Read `<repo_root>/docs/workflow/tracker-config.yaml` and the `backend:` key:

| `backend` | Routed to |
|---|---|
| `filesystem` | `idc:idc-tracker-filesystem` (a root `TRACKER.md`; zero setup) |
| `github` | `idc:idc-tracker-github` (a GitHub Projects v2 board) |

Any other value → **halt** with `unknown_backend: <value>`. The adapter never
default-falls-back to a backend — an explicit mismatch is a programmer error that must
surface, not silently degrade.

## The interface (six core ops + conveniences)

Identical across backends; the adapter routes without reshaping signatures.

| Op | Signature |
|---|---|
| `createTicket` | `(title, body, type, labels) → ticket_id` |
| `setField` | `(ticket_id, field ∈ {Wave, Phase, Domain}, value)` — non-machine fields only; Stage/Status are machine-governed (see below) |
| `link` | `(parent_id, child_id, kind ∈ {sub, blocks})` |
| `move` | `(ticket_id, status ∈ {Blocked, Todo, In Progress, Done})` |
| `query` | `(filter) → [ticket_id, …]` |
| `comment` | `(ticket_id, body)` |

Conveniences layered on the six: `claim(ticket, agent)` (Status→In Progress + claim
comment), `block(ticket, by)` (Status→Blocked + native blocked-by), `close(ticket)` (the
verdict-guarded path to Done; idempotent), and `dispose(ticket, disposition)` (the **non-verdict**
guarded path to Done — gate approval / pointer retirement / recirc-drain retirement). A seventh
core op is a contract change requiring a recirculation.

**Every board mutation routes through the transition engine.** `createTicket`, `setField` (the
non-machine fields Wave/Phase/Domain via `set-field`; a Status change via `move`; Stage owned by the
create/terminal ops), `link`, `move`, `claim`,
`block`, `close`, `dispose`, and `unblock` are engine ops: dispatch them via `python3
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/idc_transition.py"` (both backends), which validates machine-legality,
verifies the write's read-back, and journals every op to `docs/workflow/transition-journal.ndjson` —
the record the janitor's board↔journal reconciliation replays. The backend skills' raw `gh` recipes
are engine-internal mechanics — a role never runs a raw `gh project item-edit` / `gh api
…/dependencies/blocked_by` (the mutation interlock denies them during an active command).

- **Minting an item** — `createTicket` (a Buildable), the **consideration pointer**, and a
  **Recirculation intake** ticket dispatch through the engine's create ops — `create-ticket`
  (`Stage=Buildable`), `create-pointer` (`Stage=Consideration`), and `recirculate-intake`
  (`Stage=Recirculation`) — which own the **complete** create + board-add + Stage + Status + marker
  comment + read-back sequence atomically, so every minted item lands normalized (never
  Stage-without-Status) and journaled. The engine is the only create door.
  A role **never** hand-mints an item with a raw `gh issue create` / `gh project item-add` / filesystem `create`.
- **Setting a non-machine field** — `setField(ticket, Wave|Phase|Domain, value)` dispatches to
  the engine's `set-field` op (resolves ids, writes the single-select value, journals it); never a raw `gh project item-edit`.
  Stage and Status are machine-governed and `set-field` refuses BOTH. A **Status** change is a
  transition — use `move` (`--to-status`). **Stage** is owned by the ops that already set it: the
  create ops (`create-ticket`/`create-pointer`/`recirculate-intake`) write the initial Stage, and the
  terminal dispositions (`dispose --disposition retired`/`drained`) record the final Stage — there is
  no standalone Stage-write door, and no role writes Stage through a raw path.
- **Creating a block** — `link(parent, child, blocks)` dispatches to the engine's `link` op, which
  writes BOTH the native GitHub blocked-by edge (what the drain reads) AND the marker, fail-closing if
  the native edge does not land; never a raw `dependencies/blocked_by` POST.
- **Removing a block** — `unblock --num <blocked> --by <gate>` removes the `gate blocks <blocked>`
  dependency (verified absent) and then moves the blocked item `Blocked → Todo` in one guarded op;
  never a raw dependency edit.

`Done` is reachable ONLY through a guarded terminal op — `close` (a passing, item-owning
verdict) for built work, or `dispose --disposition {gate-approved|retired|drained}` (its
deterministic evidence guard) for the non-verdict terminal dispositions. The backend skills' raw
helpers stay the mechanics for **reads only** — every board *mutation* goes through an engine op.

### Merge lease (single-holder serialization)

For merge serialization — where one holder must be proven **atomically** before touching the
integration ref (e.g. flat pi finisher residents with no orchestrator) — the adapter exposes a
fail-closed lease: `leaseAcquire(name, owner, ttl) → token | fail` and `leaseRelease(name,
token)`. Backends realize it differently:

- **filesystem** — implemented: `lease-acquire`/`lease-release` (flock-backed acquire-if-empty-
  or-expired, release-by-token, TTL expiry). See `idc:idc-tracker-filesystem`.
- **github** — **interim**: no native compare-and-set lease yet, so merge stays **single-holder
  fail-closed** — exactly one orchestrator merges (no lease → no merge); a finisher never
  self-merges concurrently. A native Projects-field CAS lease is a tracked follow-up.

## Fail-closed posture

On backend failure (CLI exit ≠ 0, GraphQL error, write failure) the adapter surfaces the
implementation's structured error unchanged and returns non-zero — no automatic retry; the
caller decides retry/halt. It never silently swallows a tracker error before a commit.

## Authority boundaries

- Read `backend` + route only. Never mutates `tracker-config.yaml::backend`. Never edits
  `TRACKER.md` or board items directly — always through the resolved implementation
  (`idc:idc-tracker-filesystem` / `idc:idc-tracker-github`).
- Never decides backend selection (the per-repo config is the source of truth). Never
  spawns teammates. Never reads or writes canonical docs.
