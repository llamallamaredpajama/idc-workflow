# IDC Architecture (v3)

How the pieces of the IDC plugin fit together: the flow, the five guardrails, the
write-authority boundaries, the tracker contract, the runtime model, and how commands,
agents, and skills compose. It is derived from `templates/WORKFLOW.md` (the contract a
governed repo installs) and `docs/specs/master-architectural-spec.md` (the plugin's own
architecture). For the human-facing picture of the whole system, read
[`mental-model.md`](mental-model.md) — the **pipeline**; this document is its precise
counterpart. For the rules a governed project runs under, read that project's `WORKFLOW.md`.

## The flow

```
Think → Plan → Build        (the Recirculator heals drift; Autorun drains the whole pipe)
```

In water-rig terms (see [`mental-model.md`](mental-model.md)): the **Think Tank** (`/idc:think`)
crystallizes an idea into a PRD + TRD and fires the **one gate** (the Think PR, **Diverter #1**);
once admitted, the **processing train** (`/idc:plan`) decomposes it, and the build triplet —
**Implementer → review filter → Finisher** (`/idc:build`) — runs each wave and ends at **Diverter #2**
(ship or return). The **Recirculator** is Diverter #2's controlled backflow; **Autorun** is the
**Faucet** that opens the whole pipe at once.

The five-layer canonical chain — the spine everything traces to — is:

```
PRD → TRD (architecture spec) → master implementation plan → subphase plans → pillar plans → tracker issues
```

`docs/considerations/` is pre-canonical input (Think's brainstorm). The top two layers — the **PRD**
and the **TRD** — are authored by Think and admitted **once, at the Think PR gate**; the plan layers
below them are drafted autonomously. Tracker issues are the **water in the pipe**: planning reaches
Build only by turning plans into issues, and Build reaches planning only through the Recirculator.
Flow is one-way; the chain is auditable end to end because a sensor on every component reports to the
dashboard (the board).

## Guardrails, not train tracks

v1 hand-held a weaker model with standing reviewer/fixer/researcher roles, multi-pass plan
reviews, a claim-state machine, and per-edit gates. v3 trusts the model and keeps only the
five parts of the rig that catch real derailments:

1. **The one gate at the top** — the Think PR admitting the PRD + TRD; product function never changes
   without consent, and it's asked **once**, before any work begins.
2. **Parallel pipes on separate sections** (the matrix + sequencer manifold) — wide builds never collide.
3. **The review filter** (real verification surfaces) — nothing reaches the Glass that isn't green on
   genuine functional tests.
4. **The Recirculator** (controlled backflow) — docs and reality never silently diverge.
5. **One-way flow + the metered dashboard** — the chain is auditable end to end.

Everything else flows autonomously and automerges when green.

## Write-authority boundaries

Each role is the sole writer of its surface and edits nothing upstream of it.

| Role | May write | Must NOT write |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Think** | `docs/considerations/` + the gated PRD + TRD (drafted on the Think PR) | plans, tracker, source, tests |
| **Plan** | master/subphase/pillar plans, pillar matrices, tracker issues — pure decomposition | PRD, TRD, source, tests |
| **Build** | source, tests, review reports, tracker status (claim/close) | PRD, TRD, plans |
| **Recirculator** | every affected canonical doc (one synchronized PR), affected open issues | source, tests |

When a lower role finds a higher layer wrong, it routes through the Recirculator (files a
recirculation) and pauses only the affected issue — it never edits the upstream doc itself.

## The one gate (Diverter #1 → the Think PR)

The single human checkpoint fires at the **end of Think**. When an idea crystallizes, Think drafts its
**PRD** (*what the software does for the user*) and **TRD** (*how it's built* — the `spec` layer) and
opens a **Think PR** carrying that draft, plus one gate issue (plain-terms summary + the PRD/TRD diff);
the operator is push-notified and opens the gate from the GitHub web UI. The PRD/TRD stay **draft until
merge** — **merge = approval = admission**. Approval is **sync or async** (in-session, or leave the PR
open and approve later). The PRD always gates while `gating.prd: on`; the TRD (the `spec` layer) gates
when `gating.trd: on` (greenfield off / brownfield on). The Recirculator **reuses this same gate** for
any backflow that needs a requirements change — implemented identically via `idc:idc-gate-issue`, **one
valve shared by the top gate and backflow**. Once the Think PR merges, planning and building free-flow;
nothing else asks for permission.

## The tracker contract (the dashboard)

The board is the rig's **dashboard** — a sensor on every component, not part of the plumbing
itself. The backend is selected by `backend:` in `docs/workflow/tracker-config.yaml` and hidden
behind `idc:idc-tracker-adapter` (→ `idc:idc-tracker-github` or `idc:idc-tracker-filesystem`).
The board carries **five** fields — `Status` (`Blocked|Todo|In Progress|Done`), `Stage`
(`Consideration|Planning|Buildable` — which part of the pipe each drop is in; `Consideration` = an open
Think PR pending admission), `Wave`, `Phase`, `Domain` — plus native blocked-by, an `attempt:<n>`
label, and claim comments. `Stage` is **additive**: a board provisioned before it existed reads an
absent `Stage` as `Buildable` and keeps working as a legacy 4-field board. The interface is six ops
(createTicket/setField/link/move/query/comment). An issue body is a self-sufficient 6-element goal
contract, so an outside agent can work it cold.

## Runtime model — one core, thin adapters

The process is written against three abstract primitives — **durable worker**, **bounded
fan-out**, **goal loop** — and exactly one adapter per runtime maps them to mechanics
(`idc:idc-adapter-claude`, `idc:idc-adapter-codex`, `idc:idc-adapter-pi`). There is no
per-runtime process tree. Concurrency budget: Think/Plan/Recirculator use zero durable workers (bounded
fan-out only); Build uses one durable worker per parallel-safe issue; review is bounded fan-out
everywhere. Model selection is **tier-symbolic** (`reasoning`/`standard`/`utility` in
`WORKFLOW-config.yaml::model_routing`, resolved by the adapter at spawn time); the Codex runtime
is untiered.

**Gate model parity across runtimes.** All three runtimes implement the v3 gate at the end of Think
(Diverter #1 → the Think PR): Think authors **and** gates the PRD + TRD, and Plan is pure
decomposition that authors no requirements and runs no gate. In the optional, **experimental Pi
runtime** this is enforced structurally — the role-harness write-authority gives Think (not Plan)
`docs/prd` + `docs/specs`, and the `think`/`plan` personas encode author-at-Think / pure-decompose.
The full Think→Plan→Build lifecycle runs end-to-end on Pi against a real LLM — one `PI_IDC_MODEL`
umbrella (provider-qualified) boots every role, no per-role pinning required — but a parallel Build
pool and a Pi-side autorun drain remain pending (#66 L1/L4), which is why the runtime stays
experimental.

## The eleven commands — one altitude each

IDC ships **11 slash entry points**:

```text
think | intake | plan | build | recirculate | autorun | janitor | init | doctor | update | uninstall
```

Six of them admit or move scope, and the boundary between them is the load-bearing part — each
admits scope at exactly one altitude, and none may do another's job:

- **Think** shapes one new requirement and opens its human gate.
- **Intake** compiles a large foreign artifact into complete routes; it does not execute the artifact.
- **Recirculation** admits already-covered but unplanned scope.
- **Plan** decomposes admitted considerations only.
- **Build** consumes eligible schema-checked Buildables only.
- **Autorun** drains durable tracker/intake state only.

The remaining five are operational, not scope-bearing: `janitor` reconciles, `init` scaffolds,
`doctor` diagnoses, and `update` / `uninstall` are the lifecycle pair.

Read that list as the write-authority table's twin. A foreign plan — a vendor spec, a migration
doc, a hand-written roadmap — is **evidence, never execution authority**: Intake compiles it into
routes, and each route still enters the pipe through Think's gate or Recirculation's admission. It
may never mint a Buildable directly, which is why Build "infer the foreign plan" is not a step that
exists anywhere in the rig.

## Completion honesty — what "green" never proved

The rig's definition of finished used to be "the build lane is empty", and that is blind in two
directions. Both are closed by fail-closed checks at wave close, wired into the drain's existing
non-terminal exit — the same exit the Stop fixpoint gate already refuses a stop on, so enforcement
needed no new hook.

**The dashboard can lie.** The board is a sensor, not plumbing, and sensors drift. Finishing an item
merges its PR — which auto-closes the issue via the closing keyword — and flips the board Status a
few steps later; a session dying in between leaves the item shipped but still reading `In Progress`.
Nothing noticed: the acceptance check audits only merged-`Done` items and the drain counts only
`Todo`, so the pipe declared itself complete over work it was still advertising as in flight.
`idc_finish_coherence.py` asks the missing question, reusing the janitor's existing coherence verdict
rather than minting a second definition of it.

**Green code is not a working product.** Every guardrail above verifies code, and the things that
most often break a deployment are not in the reviewed diff at all — an uncreated bucket, an unset env
var, a hand-granted role. IDC cannot know how to deploy an arbitrary product, so the project
**declares** its live surfaces and IDC enforces the obligation: `idc_live_check.py` requires committed
evidence that each declared surface was driven, and that evidence expires the moment anything lands
on the paths behind it (its infrastructure included). A repo that declares no live surface is never
gated — opting in is the only way to be gated.

## Stale runtime — `/reload-plugins`, not `/clear`

A Claude Code session loads a plugin's commands, agents, and skills **once, at session start**.
Editing this repo (or installing a new IDC version) does not change what an already-running session
executes: it keeps running the component bodies it loaded. That is the stale-runtime hazard — a
session silently running old command logic against a newer governed repo.

Recovery is **`/reload-plugins`** (or a full session restart). **`/clear` does not reload plugin
components** — it clears conversation context and leaves the loaded command/agent/skill bodies
exactly as they were, so a refusal that says "run `/clear`" would send an operator in a circle.
Every stale-runtime refusal IDC emits therefore names `/reload-plugins` and states explicitly that
`/clear` is insufficient. The install receipt's `plugin_version` is what makes the refusal
possible: `scripts/idc_plugin_freshness.py` reads it as the running plugin's *required* version, so
a session older than the version that stamped the repo is refused rather than trusted.

One consequence is unavoidable and is part of the release procedure rather than a bug: an upgrade
cannot retroactively add a hook to an already-running older session, so the **first** session after
installing a version that introduces the gate needs one explicit `/reload-plugins` or restart. After
that bootstrap, every future loaded version carries the gate itself.

## Composition + naming

- **Commands** (`commands/*.md`) are the slash entry points; `/idc:plan` tells the session to
  operate as the Plan orchestrator by reading the matching agent playbook.
- **Agents** (`agents/*.md`) are the per-stage orchestrators, the durable-worker implementer +
  finisher, and the review coordinator.
- **Skills** (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) are the reusable procedures the roles compose.

All agents and skills use a flat `idc-<thing>` name; the harness adds the `idc:` namespace.
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to the install path inside command/agent/skill bodies (it is
text-substituted, not a shell env var). `scripts/lint-references.sh` enforces that every
`idc:<name>` reference and every shipped-path token resolves to a real file.

## Required trace (the audit rule)

Subphase plans record their upstream master domain/phase; pillar plans record their upstream
subphase; each issue's `Trace:` line cites its pillar · consideration · PRD section. These
traces let any issue be walked back to the requirement that justified it — and let the Recirculator
compute the highest affected layer when something drifts (the backflow target).
